# COCObard

[COCObard](https://ryanfb.github.io/cocobard/) is my contribution to [NaPoGenMo 2017](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017). It uses a dataset of [my neural_tv twitter bot's](http://twitter.com/neural_tv) utterances with the [Datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/) to generate [Shakespearean rhyme scheme sonnets](http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/RCOldSite/www/rchs/sonnet.htm) of the form `ABAB CDCD EFEF GG`.

The name of this entry comes from the [MS COCO](http://mscoco.org/) dataset used by the [neuraltalk2 model](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2) behind @neural\_tv. This dataset is used to train/test many computer vision algorithms. COCObard is intended as a tongue-in-cheek exploration of what happens when we stretch how we teach machines to "see" across domains.
